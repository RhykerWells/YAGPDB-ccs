> # :warning: **Deprecation notice**
As of 22/04/2025 (22nd of April, 2025), this repository and the commands found within have been deprecated in favour of the bot I am writing, [ASBWIG](https://github.com/RhykerWells/asbwig). These commands should be stable as of writing this, with little to no errors.  

This repository will stay open in case there are any major bugs.

## Welcome message
Welcome to my YAGPDB CC repository! <br />
This repository hosts the largest made economy system for the YAGPDB.xyz custom command system.<br />
The economy system has been worked on since mid 2021 and has taken a lot of work to get it to the current state.<br />
As you can see, a lot of effort has gone into these, and regardless as to whether they are used or not; they are still incredibly fun to make.<br />
I appreciate every fork and star and those who use my commands!
